# TestCodingShortcuts
Testing some coding shortcuts that I will want to use later in R

A few things that I want to learn how to implement in R based on what I have seen on the internet

* equivalents for MATCH and VLOOKUP, including the interval (non-exact) portions
* SET BY and MERGE BY (using dplyr or plyr?)
* normalizing and denormalizing data (tidy principles, using tidyr)
* sorting
* expanding knowledge of the base graphing package


All simple things to do, but knowing these will advance my capabilities in R
  
### Contents as of 17-FEB-2016  
* Exercise001 is for a general algorithm for lookups, aggregation/calculation, and graphing  
* TaverasRforExcel is for expanding on tips and tricks from Taveras (author of "R for Excel") with some of my explorations  

### Expansion ideas for 22-FEB-2016  
* Exercise002 is for both simplifying the Exercise001 code and then expanding it to include covariance
