# TestCodingShortcuts
Testing some coding shortcuts that I will want to use later in R

A few things that I want to learn how to implement in R based on what I have seen on the internet

* equivalents for MATCH and VLOOKUP, including the interval (non-exact) portions
* SET BY and MERGE BY (using dplyr or plyr?)
* normalizing and denormalizing data (tidy principles, using tidyr)
* sorting

All simple things to do, but knowing these will advance my capabilities in R
