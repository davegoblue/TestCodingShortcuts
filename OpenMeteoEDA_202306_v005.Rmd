## Background
Open-Meteo maintains an [API for historical weather](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api) that allows for non-commercial usage of historical weather data maintained by the website.

This file builds on _v001, _v002, _v003, and _v004 to run exploratory analysis on some historical weather data.

## Functions and Libraries
The exploration process uses tidyverse, ranger, several generic custom functions, and several functions specific to Open Meteo processing. First, tidyverse, ranger, and the generic functions are loaded:  
```{r}

library(tidyverse) # tidyverse functionality is included throughout
library(ranger) # predict() does not work on ranger objects unless ranger has been called

source("./Generic_Added_Utility_Functions_202105_v001.R") # Basic functions

```
