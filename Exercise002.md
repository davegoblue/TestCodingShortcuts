## Overall objective:  
Extend Exercise001 by making the code simpler and more efficient where possible.  
  
#### *Simplification objectives*  
The Exercise001 code uses mostly matrices and base.  These are fine unless the data become very large, at which point the code hogs memory and takes a long time.  Come up with approaches to simplify the processing and make it more efficient (keep as few items as possible, leverage dplyr, etc.).
